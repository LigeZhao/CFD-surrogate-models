This is the official repository of paper"Evaluating Different CFD Surrogate Modelling Approaches for Fast and Accurate Indoor Environment Simulation"

# Overview
CFD is a widely employed method for simulating building environments, but it is computationally demanding, particularly for large spaces. To tackle this challenge, we conducted a systematic comparison of three methodologies for enhancing CFD calculations: POD surrogate modeling, ANN surrogate modeling, and a combined POD-ANN surrogate modeling approach. Our evaluation focused on assessing the accuracy of the models and their computational requirements, including model size (indicative of memory usage) and computational time.
